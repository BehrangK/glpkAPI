GNU R package glpkAPI: R Interface to C API of GLPK


The installation procedure for the glpkAPI package needs to know where to
find the GLPK include directory and where to find the callable library.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Linux and MacOS X installation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

There are basically three different ways of installing the glpkAPI package:

1) Use --with-glpk-<ARG>

   --with-glpk-include=PATH     with PATH being the include directory of GLPK

   --with-glpk-lib=PATH         with PATH being the directory containing the
                                callable library.

   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=" \
       --with-glpk-include=/path/to/include/dir \
       --with-glpk-lib=/path/to/lib/dir" glpkAPI_X.X.X.tar.gz


   When using --with-glpk-<ARG>, both arguments must be given.

2) Use of environment variables

   GLPK_INCLUDE                giving the PATH to the include directory of GLPK
   GLPK_LIB                    giving the PATH to the directory containing the
                               callable library.

3) Use --prefix

   --prefix=PATH               with path being the installation directory of
                               GLPK. The include directory is assumed to be
                               PATH/include and the callable library should be
                               in PATH/lib.

   If either --with-glpk-<ARG> nor --prefix is given, it is checked wether
   glpsol is in the PATH. If yes, PATH is used as prefix. If not,
   /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib are tested.


If one wants to use GNU BIGNUMin order to use glp_exact, use --enable-gmp
(default is set to yes).

# Windows installation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

For the installation on Windows systems the file Makewars.win in src/ is
required. The file looks like this:

PKG_CPPFLAGS=-g -D_R_=1 -DUSE_R=1 -I${GLPK_PATH}/include
PKG_LIBS=-L${GLPK_PATH}/lib -L${GMP_PATH}/lib -lglpk -lgmp

with the environment variable GLPK_PATH being the installation directory
of GLPK and GMP_PATH being the installation directory of GNU BIGNUM. This
procedure was tested successfully on 32-bit Windows XP.
